# PasswordGenerator
![JavaScript]https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/PeterKim89/PasswordGenerator

## Introduction
This password generator takes user input on how long they would like their password to be.
As long as the user's input falls within the allowed bounds of 8-128 characters, the user will then
be prompted to choose from various character types to include. These character types include
special characters, numbers, lowercase and uppercase english letters. 
Through creating this password generator, I learned how to handle various JavaScript methods and elements,
such as event handlers, query selectors, and prompt boxes. 

## Build Process
- Read the user story and acceptance criteria
- Break the task down into smaller topics of how to handle the button and event handlers, how to handle prompt boxes, and how to perform the logic required to generate a random password
- Write pseudocode for the various tasks
- Created variable names and possible values / datatypes
- Created the logic required for randomly selecting a character within specified parameters
- Created alert boxes, prompt box, and confirm boxes
- Put all the various functions together to create generatePassword() and writePassword()
- Refactor and condense functions and unneeded variables
